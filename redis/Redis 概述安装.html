<span class="token comment">################################## MODULES #####################################</span>

<span class="token comment"># Load modules at startup. If the server is not able to load modules</span>
<span class="token comment"># it will abort. It is possible to use multiple loadmodule directives.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># loadmodule /path/to/my_module.so</span>
<span class="token comment"># loadmodule /path/to/other_module.so</span>

<span class="token comment">################################## NETWORK #####################################</span>

<span class="token comment"># By default, if no &quot;bind&quot; configuration directive is specified, Redis listens</span>
<span class="token comment"># for connections from all available network interfaces on the host machine.</span>
<span class="token comment"># It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using</span>
<span class="token comment"># the &quot;bind&quot; configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.</span>
<span class="token comment"># Each address can be prefixed by &quot;-&quot;, which means that redis will not fail to</span>
<span class="token comment"># start if the address is not available. Being not available only refers to</span>
<span class="token comment"># addresses that does not correspond to any network interface. Addresses that</span>
<span class="token comment"># are already in use will always fail, and unsupported protocols will always BE</span>
<span class="token comment"># silently skipped.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Examples:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1     # listens on two specific IPv4 addresses</span>
<span class="token comment"># bind 127.0.0.1 ::1              # listens on loopback IPv4 and IPv6</span>
<span class="token comment"># bind * -::*                     # like the default, all available interfaces</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the</span>
<span class="token comment"># internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the</span>
<span class="token comment"># instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the</span>
<span class="token comment"># following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only on the</span>
<span class="token comment"># IPv4 and IPv6 (if available) loopback interface addresses (this means Redis</span>
<span class="token comment"># will only be able to accept client connections from the same host that it is</span>
<span class="token comment"># running on).</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES</span>
<span class="token comment"># COMMENT OUT THE FOLLOWING LINE.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># You will also need to set a password unless you explicitly disable protected</span>
<span class="token comment"># mode.</span>
<span class="token comment"># ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>
<span class="token comment"># bind 127.0.0.1 -::1</span>

<span class="token comment"># By default, outgoing connections (from replica to master, from Sentinel to</span>
<span class="token comment"># instances, cluster bus, etc.) are not bound to a specific local address. In</span>
<span class="token comment"># most cases, this means the operating system will handle that based on routing</span>
<span class="token comment"># and the interface through which the connection goes out.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Using bind-source-addr it is possible to configure a specific address to bind</span>
<span class="token comment"># to, which may also affect how the connection gets routed.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Example:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># bind-source-addr 10.0.0.1</span>

<span class="token comment"># Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that</span>
<span class="token comment"># Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># When protected mode is on and the default user has no password, the server</span>
<span class="token comment"># only accepts local connections from the IPv4 address (127.0.0.1), IPv6 address</span>
<span class="token comment"># (::1) or Unix domain sockets.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if</span>
<span class="token comment"># you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to Redis</span>
<span class="token comment"># even if no authentication is configured.</span>
<span class="token attr-name">protected-mode</span> <span class="token attr-value">yes</span>

<span class="token comment"># Redis uses default hardened security configuration directives to reduce the</span>

<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Configuration directives that control files that Redis writes to (e.g., 'dir'</span>
<span class="token comment"># and 'dbfilename') and that aren't usually modified during runtime</span>
<span class="token comment"># are protected by making them immutable.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Commands that can increase the attack surface of Redis and that aren't usually</span>
<span class="token comment"># called by users are blocked by default.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># These can be exposed to either all connections or just local ones by setting</span>
<span class="token comment"># each of the configs listed below to either of these values:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># no    - Block for any connection (remain immutable)</span>
<span class="token comment"># yes   - Allow for any connection (no protection)</span>
<span class="token comment"># local - Allow only for local connections. Ones originating from the</span>

<span class="token comment"># Master-Replica replication. Use replicaof to make a Redis instance a copy of</span>
<span class="token comment"># another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment">#   +------------------+      +---------------+</span>
<span class="token comment">#   |      Master      | ---&gt; |    Replica    |</span>
<span class="token comment">#   | (receive writes) |      |  (exact copy) |</span>
<span class="token comment">#   +------------------+      +---------------+</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to</span>
<span class="token comment">#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least</span>
<span class="token comment">#    a given number of replicas.</span>
<span class="token comment"># 2) Redis replicas are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the</span>
<span class="token comment">#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of</span>
<span class="token comment">#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next</span>
<span class="token comment">#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.</span>
<span class="token comment"># 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a</span>
<span class="token comment">#    network partition replicas automatically try to reconnect to masters</span>
<span class="token comment">#    and resynchronize with them.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># replicaof 192.168.25.10 6379</span>

<span class="token comment"># If the master is password protected (using the &quot;requirepass&quot; configuration</span>
<span class="token comment"># directive below) it is possible to tell the replica to authenticate before</span>
<span class="token comment"># starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will</span>
<span class="token comment"># refuse the replica request.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># masterauth 111111</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># However this is not enough if you are using Redis ACLs (for Redis version</span>
<span class="token comment"># 6 or greater), and the default user is not capable of running the PSYNC</span>
<span class="token comment"># command and/or other commands needed for replication. In this case it's</span>
<span class="token comment"># better to configure a special user to use with replication, and specify the</span>
<span class="token comment"># masteruser configuration as such:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># masteruser &lt;username&gt;</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># When masteruser is specified, the replica will authenticate against its</span>
<span class="token comment"># master using the new AUTH form: AUTH &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;.</span>

<span class="token comment"># When a replica loses its connection with the master, or when the replication</span>
<span class="token comment"># is still in progress, the replica can act in two different ways:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># 1) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the replica will</span>
<span class="token comment">#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the</span>
<span class="token comment">#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># 2) If replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the replica will reply with error</span>
<span class="token comment">#    &quot;MASTERDOWN Link with MASTER is down and replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'no'&quot;</span>
<span class="token comment">#    to all data access commands, excluding commands such as:</span>
<span class="token comment">#    INFO, REPLICAOF, AUTH, SHUTDOWN, REPLCONF, ROLE, CONFIG, SUBSCRIBE,</span>
<span class="token comment">#    UNSUBSCRIBE, PSUBSCRIBE, PUNSUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, PUBSUB, COMMAND, POST,</span>
<span class="token comment">#    HOST and LATENCY.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token attr-name">replica-serve-stale-data</span> <span class="token attr-value">yes</span>

<span class="token comment"># You can configure a replica instance to accept writes or not. Writing against</span>
<span class="token comment"># a replica instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data</span>
<span class="token comment"># written on a replica will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but</span>
<span class="token comment"># may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a</span>
<span class="token comment"># misconfiguration.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Since Redis 2.6 by default replicas are read-only.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Note: read only replicas are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients</span>
<span class="token comment"># on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.</span>
<span class="token comment"># Still a read only replica exports by default all the administrative commands</span>
<span class="token comment"># such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve</span>
<span class="token comment"># security of read only replicas using 'rename-command' to shadow all the</span>
<span class="token comment"># administrative / dangerous commands.</span>
<span class="token attr-name">replica-read-only</span> <span class="token attr-value">yes</span>

<span class="token comment"># Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># New replicas and reconnecting replicas that are not able to continue the</span>
<span class="token comment"># replication process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a</span>
<span class="token comment"># &quot;full synchronization&quot;. An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the</span>
<span class="token comment"># replicas.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The transmission can happen in two different ways:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB</span>
<span class="token comment">#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent</span>
<span class="token comment">#                 process to the replicas incrementally.</span>
<span class="token comment"># 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the</span>
<span class="token comment">#              RDB file to replica sockets, without touching the disk at all.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more replicas</span>
<span class="token comment"># can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child</span>
<span class="token comment"># producing the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead</span>
<span class="token comment"># once the transfer starts, new replicas arriving will be queued and a new</span>
<span class="token comment"># transfer will start when the current one terminates.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of</span>
<span class="token comment"># time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple</span>
<span class="token comment"># replicas will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication</span>
<span class="token comment"># works better.</span>
<span class="token attr-name">repl-diskless-sync</span> <span class="token attr-value">yes</span>

<span class="token comment"># When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay</span>
<span class="token comment"># the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket</span>
<span class="token comment"># to the replicas.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve</span>
<span class="token comment"># new replicas arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the</span>
<span class="token comment"># server waits a delay in order to let more replicas arrive.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable</span>
<span class="token comment"># it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.</span>

<span class="token comment"># number of replicas expected have connected. Default of 0 means that the</span>

<span class="token comment"># -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="token comment"># WARNING: RDB diskless load is experimental. Since in this setup the replica</span>
<span class="token comment"># does not immediately store an RDB on disk, it may cause data loss during</span>

<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># If an application wants to ensure there is no data divergence, this configuration</span>

<span class="token comment"># It is not recommended to change this default, however in order to be compatible</span>

<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># This option does not change the behavior of replica-priority. Even with</span>

<span class="token comment"># For example to require at least 3 replicas with a lag &lt;= 10 seconds use:</span>

<span class="token comment"># A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached</span>

<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The listed IP address and port normally reported by a replica is</span>

<span class="token comment">#   of the socket used by the replica to connect with the master.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment">#   Port: The port is communicated by the replica during the replication</span>
<span class="token comment">#   handshake, and is normally the port that the replica is using to</span>
<span class="token comment">#   listen for connections.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is</span>

<span class="token comment"># pairs. The following two options can be used by a replica in order to</span>
<span class="token comment"># report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO</span>
<span class="token comment"># and ROLE will report those values.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>

<span class="token comment">############################### KEYS TRACKING #################################</span>

<span class="token comment"># Redis implements server assisted support for client side caching of values.</span>
<span class="token comment"># This is implemented using an invalidation table that remembers, using</span>
<span class="token comment"># a radix key indexed by key name, what clients have which keys. In turn</span>
<span class="token comment"># this is used in order to send invalidation messages to clients. Please</span>
<span class="token comment"># check this page to understand more about the feature:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment">#   https://redis.io/topics/client-side-caching</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># When tracking is enabled for a client, all the read only queries are assumed</span>
<span class="token comment"># to be cached: this will force Redis to store information in the invalidation</span>
<span class="token comment"># table. When keys are modified, such information is flushed away, and</span>
<span class="token comment"># invalidation messages are sent to the clients. However if the workload is</span>
<span class="token comment"># heavily dominated by reads, Redis could use more and more memory in order</span>
<span class="token comment"># to track the keys fetched by many clients.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># For this reason it is possible to configure a maximum fill value for the</span>
<span class="token comment"># invalidation table. By default it is set to 1M of keys, and once this limit</span>
<span class="token comment"># is reached, Redis will start to evict keys in the invalidation table</span>
<span class="token comment"># even if they were not modified, just to reclaim memory: this will in turn</span>
<span class="token comment"># force the clients to invalidate the cached values. Basically the table</span>
<span class="token comment"># maximum size is a trade off between the memory you want to spend server</span>
<span class="token comment"># side to track information about who cached what, and the ability of clients</span>
<span class="token comment"># to retain cached objects in memory.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># If you set the value to 0, it means there are no limits, and Redis will</span>
<span class="token comment"># retain as many keys as needed in the invalidation table.</span>
<span class="token comment"># In the &quot;stats&quot; INFO section, you can find information about the number of</span>
<span class="token comment"># keys in the invalidation table at every given moment.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Note: when key tracking is used in broadcasting mode, no memory is used</span>
<span class="token comment"># in the server side so this setting is useless.</span>

<span class="token comment"># Note that because the password is really a shared secret between the client</span>
<span class="token comment"># and the server, and should not be memorized by any human, the password</span>

<span class="token comment"># ACL rules can be specified in any order: for instance you can start with</span>
<span class="token comment"># passwords, then flags, or key patterns. However note that the additive</span>

<span class="token comment"># For instance see the following example:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment">#   user alice on +@all -DEBUG ~* &gt;somepassword</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># This will allow &quot;alice&quot; to use all the commands with the exception of the</span>
<span class="token comment"># DEBUG command, since +@all added all the commands to the set of the commands</span>
<span class="token comment"># alice can use, and later DEBUG was removed. However if we invert the order</span>
<span class="token comment"># of two ACL rules the result will be different:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment">#   user alice on -DEBUG +@all ~* &gt;somepassword</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Now DEBUG was removed when alice had yet no commands in the set of allowed</span>
<span class="token comment"># commands, later all the commands are added, so the user will be able to</span>
<span class="token comment"># execute everything.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>

<span class="token comment"># This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU or LFU cache, or to</span>

<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># WARNING: If you have replicas attached to an instance with maxmemory on,</span>
<span class="token comment"># the size of the output buffers needed to feed the replicas are subtracted</span>

<span class="token comment"># buffer of replicas is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion</span>
<span class="token comment"># of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># In short... if you have replicas attached it is suggested that you set a lower</span>

<span class="token comment"># allkeys-lru -&gt; Evict any key using approximated LRU.</span>

<span class="token comment"># volatile-random -&gt; Remove a random key having an expire set.</span>
<span class="token comment"># allkeys-random -&gt; Remove a random key, any key.</span>
<span class="token comment"># volatile-ttl -&gt; Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)</span>
<span class="token comment"># noeviction -&gt; Don't evict anything, just return an error on write operations.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># LRU means Least Recently Used</span>
<span class="token comment"># LFU means Least Frequently Used</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>

<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Note: with any of the above policies, when there are no suitable keys for</span>
<span class="token comment"># eviction, Redis will return an error on write operations that require</span>
<span class="token comment"># more memory. These are usually commands that create new keys, add data or</span>
<span class="token comment"># modify existing keys. A few examples are: SET, INCR, HSET, LPUSH, SUNIONSTORE,</span>
<span class="token comment"># SORT (due to the STORE argument), and EXEC (if the transaction includes any</span>
<span class="token comment"># command that requires memory).</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The default is:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># maxmemory-policy noeviction</span>

<span class="token comment"># LRU, LFU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated</span>
<span class="token comment"># algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or</span>
<span class="token comment"># accuracy. By default Redis will check five keys and pick the one that was</span>
<span class="token comment"># used least recently, you can change the sample size using the following</span>
<span class="token comment"># configuration directive.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely</span>

<span class="token comment"># Eviction processing is designed to function well with the default setting.</span>
<span class="token comment"># If there is an unusually large amount of write traffic, this value may need to</span>
<span class="token comment"># be increased.  Decreasing this value may reduce latency at the risk of</span>

<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Note that since the replica by default does not evict, it may end using more</span>

<span class="token comment"># be larger on the replica, or data structures may sometimes take more memory</span>
<span class="token comment"># and so forth). So make sure you monitor your replicas and make sure they</span>

<span class="token comment"># looking for expired keys to reclaim, so that it is possible to free memory</span>
<span class="token comment"># of keys that are expired and will never be accessed again in a short time.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The default effort of the expire cycle will try to avoid having more than</span>
<span class="token comment"># ten percent of expired keys still in memory, and will try to avoid consuming</span>
<span class="token comment"># more than 25% of total memory and to add latency to the system. However</span>
<span class="token comment"># it is possible to increase the expire &quot;effort&quot; that is normally set to</span>
<span class="token comment"># &quot;1&quot;, to a greater value, up to the value &quot;10&quot;. At its maximum value the</span>
<span class="token comment"># system will use more CPU, longer cycles (and technically may introduce</span>
<span class="token comment"># more latency), and will tolerate less already expired keys still present</span>

<span class="token comment">############################# LAZY FREEING ####################################</span>

<span class="token comment"># Redis has two primitives to delete keys. One is called DEL and is a blocking</span>
<span class="token comment"># deletion of the object. It means that the server stops processing new commands</span>
<span class="token comment"># in order to reclaim all the memory associated with an object in a synchronous</span>
<span class="token comment"># way. If the key deleted is associated with a small object, the time needed</span>
<span class="token comment"># in order to execute the DEL command is very small and comparable to most other</span>
<span class="token comment"># O(1) or O(log_N) commands in Redis. However if the key is associated with an</span>
<span class="token comment"># aggregated value containing millions of elements, the server can block for</span>
<span class="token comment"># a long time (even seconds) in order to complete the operation.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># For the above reasons Redis also offers non blocking deletion primitives</span>
<span class="token comment"># such as UNLINK (non blocking DEL) and the ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and</span>
<span class="token comment"># FLUSHDB commands, in order to reclaim memory in background. Those commands</span>
<span class="token comment"># are executed in constant time. Another thread will incrementally free the</span>
<span class="token comment"># object in the background as fast as possible.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># DEL, UNLINK and ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and FLUSHDB are user-controlled.</span>
<span class="token comment"># It's up to the design of the application to understand when it is a good</span>
<span class="token comment"># idea to use one or the other. However the Redis server sometimes has to</span>
<span class="token comment"># delete keys or flush the whole database as a side effect of other operations.</span>
<span class="token comment"># Specifically Redis deletes objects independently of a user call in the</span>
<span class="token comment"># following scenarios:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># 1) On eviction, because of the maxmemory and maxmemory policy configurations,</span>
<span class="token comment">#    in order to make room for new data, without going over the specified</span>
<span class="token comment">#    memory limit.</span>
<span class="token comment"># 2) Because of expire: when a key with an associated time to live (see the</span>
<span class="token comment">#    EXPIRE command) must be deleted from memory.</span>
<span class="token comment"># 3) Because of a side effect of a command that stores data on a key that may</span>
<span class="token comment">#    already exist. For example the RENAME command may delete the old key</span>
<span class="token comment">#    content when it is replaced with another one. Similarly SUNIONSTORE</span>
<span class="token comment">#    or SORT with STORE option may delete existing keys. The SET command</span>
<span class="token comment">#    itself removes any old content of the specified key in order to replace</span>
<span class="token comment">#    it with the specified string.</span>
<span class="token comment"># 4) During replication, when a replica performs a full resynchronization with</span>
<span class="token comment">#    its master, the content of the whole database is removed in order to</span>
<span class="token comment">#    load the RDB file just transferred.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># In all the above cases the default is to delete objects in a blocking way,</span>
<span class="token comment"># like if DEL was called. However you can configure each case specifically</span>
<span class="token comment"># in order to instead release memory in a non-blocking way like if UNLINK</span>
<span class="token comment"># was called, using the following configuration directives.</span>

<span class="token attr-name">lazyfree-lazy-eviction</span> <span class="token attr-value">no</span>
<span class="token attr-name">lazyfree-lazy-expire</span> <span class="token attr-value">no</span>

<span class="token attr-name">replica-lazy-flush</span> <span class="token attr-value">no</span>

<span class="token comment"># It is also possible, for the case when to replace the user code DEL calls</span>
<span class="token comment"># with UNLINK calls is not easy, to modify the default behavior of the DEL</span>
<span class="token comment"># command to act exactly like UNLINK, using the following configuration</span>
<span class="token comment"># directive:</span>

<span class="token attr-name">lazyfree-lazy-user-del</span> <span class="token attr-value">no</span>

<span class="token comment"># FLUSHDB, FLUSHALL, SCRIPT FLUSH and FUNCTION FLUSH support both asynchronous and synchronous</span>
<span class="token comment"># deletion, which can be controlled by passing the [SYNC|ASYNC] flags into the</span>
<span class="token comment"># commands. When neither flag is passed, this directive will be used to determine</span>
<span class="token comment"># if the data should be deleted asynchronously.</span>

<span class="token attr-name">lazyfree-lazy-user-flush</span> <span class="token attr-value">no</span>

<span class="token comment">################################ THREADED I/O #################################</span>

<span class="token comment"># Redis is mostly single threaded, however there are certain threaded</span>
<span class="token comment"># operations such as UNLINK, slow I/O accesses and other things that are</span>
<span class="token comment"># performed on side threads.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Now it is also possible to handle Redis clients socket reads and writes</span>
<span class="token comment"># in different I/O threads. Since especially writing is so slow, normally</span>
<span class="token comment"># Redis users use pipelining in order to speed up the Redis performances per</span>
<span class="token comment"># core, and spawn multiple instances in order to scale more. Using I/O</span>
<span class="token comment"># threads it is possible to easily speedup two times Redis without resorting</span>
<span class="token comment"># to pipelining nor sharding of the instance.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># By default threading is disabled, we suggest enabling it only in machines</span>
<span class="token comment"># that have at least 4 or more cores, leaving at least one spare core.</span>
<span class="token comment"># Using more than 8 threads is unlikely to help much. We also recommend using</span>
<span class="token comment"># threaded I/O only if you actually have performance problems, with Redis</span>
<span class="token comment"># instances being able to use a quite big percentage of CPU time, otherwise</span>
<span class="token comment"># there is no point in using this feature.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># So for instance if you have a four cores boxes, try to use 2 or 3 I/O</span>
<span class="token comment"># threads, if you have a 8 cores, try to use 6 threads. In order to</span>
<span class="token comment"># enable I/O threads use the following configuration directive:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># io-threads 4</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Setting io-threads to 1 will just use the main thread as usual.</span>
<span class="token comment"># When I/O threads are enabled, we only use threads for writes, that is</span>
<span class="token comment"># to thread the write(2) syscall and transfer the client buffers to the</span>
<span class="token comment"># socket. However it is also possible to enable threading of reads and</span>
<span class="token comment"># protocol parsing using the following configuration directive, by setting</span>
<span class="token comment"># it to yes:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># io-threads-do-reads no</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Usually threading reads doesn't help much.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># NOTE 1: This configuration directive cannot be changed at runtime via</span>
<span class="token comment"># CONFIG SET. Also, this feature currently does not work when SSL is</span>
<span class="token comment"># enabled.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># NOTE 2: If you want to test the Redis speedup using redis-benchmark, make</span>
<span class="token comment"># sure you also run the benchmark itself in threaded mode, using the</span>
<span class="token comment"># --threads option to match the number of Redis threads, otherwise you'll not</span>

<span class="token comment"># replicas killed before masters.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Redis supports these options:</span>

<span class="token comment"># relative: Values are used relative to the initial value of oom_score_adj when</span>
<span class="token comment">#           the server starts and are then clamped to a range of -1000 to 1000.</span>
<span class="token comment">#           Because typically the initial value is 0, they will often match the</span>

<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># There is no simple way for a replica to actually have an exact measure of</span>
<span class="token comment"># its &quot;data age&quot;, so the following two checks are performed:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># 1) If there are multiple replicas able to failover, they exchange messages</span>
<span class="token comment">#    in order to try to give an advantage to the replica with the best</span>
<span class="token comment">#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).</span>
<span class="token comment">#    Replicas will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start</span>
<span class="token comment">#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># 2) Every single replica computes the time of the last interaction with</span>
<span class="token comment">#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master</span>
<span class="token comment">#    is still in the &quot;connected&quot; state), or the time that elapsed since the</span>
<span class="token comment">#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).</span>
<span class="token comment">#    If the last interaction is too old, the replica will not try to failover</span>
<span class="token comment">#    at all.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The point &quot;2&quot; can be tuned by user. Specifically a replica will not perform</span>

<span class="token comment"># elapsed is greater than:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment">#   (node-timeout * cluster-replica-validity-factor) + repl-ping-replica-period</span>

<span class="token comment"># for longer than 310 seconds.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># A large cluster-replica-validity-factor may allow replicas with too old data to failover</span>

<span class="token comment"># elect a replica at all.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># For maximum availability, it is possible to set the cluster-replica-validity-factor</span>
<span class="token comment"># to a value of 0, which means, that replicas will always try to failover the</span>
<span class="token comment"># master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.</span>

<span class="token comment"># will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working replica for its master</span>
<span class="token comment"># and so forth. It usually reflects the number of replicas you want for every</span>
<span class="token comment"># master in your cluster.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Default is 1 (replicas migrate only if their masters remain with at least</span>
<span class="token comment"># one replica). To disable migration just set it to a very large value or</span>

<span class="token comment"># correctly map the address of the node publishing the information.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># If cluster-tls is set to yes and cluster-announce-tls-port is omitted or set</span>

<span class="token comment"># If the above options are not used, the normal Redis Cluster auto-detection</span>

<span class="token comment">################################## SLOW LOG ###################################</span>

<span class="token comment"># The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified</span>
<span class="token comment"># execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations</span>
<span class="token comment"># like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,</span>
<span class="token comment"># but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only</span>
<span class="token comment"># stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve</span>
<span class="token comment"># other requests in the meantime).</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis</span>
<span class="token comment"># what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the</span>
<span class="token comment"># command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the</span>
<span class="token comment"># slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the</span>
<span class="token comment"># queue of logged commands.</span>

<span class="token comment"># The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent</span>
<span class="token comment"># to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while</span>

<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set</span>

<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment">#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@&lt;db&gt;__ prefix.</span>

<span class="token comment">############################### ADVANCED CONFIG ###############################</span>

<span class="token comment"># Hashes are encoded using a memory efficient data structure when they have a</span>
<span class="token comment"># small number of entries, and the biggest entry does not exceed a given</span>
<span class="token comment"># threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.</span>
<span class="token attr-name">hash-max-listpack-entries</span> <span class="token attr-value">512</span>
<span class="token attr-name">hash-max-listpack-value</span> <span class="token attr-value">64</span>

<span class="token comment"># Lists are also encoded in a special way to save a lot of space.</span>
<span class="token comment"># The number of entries allowed per internal list node can be specified</span>
<span class="token comment"># as a fixed maximum size or a maximum number of elements.</span>
<span class="token comment"># For a fixed maximum size, use -5 through -1, meaning:</span>
<span class="token comment"># -5: max size: 64 Kb  &lt;-- not recommended for normal workloads</span>
<span class="token comment"># -4: max size: 32 Kb  &lt;-- not recommended</span>
<span class="token comment"># -3: max size: 16 Kb  &lt;-- probably not recommended</span>
<span class="token comment"># -2: max size: 8 Kb   &lt;-- good</span>
<span class="token comment"># -1: max size: 4 Kb   &lt;-- good</span>
<span class="token comment"># Positive numbers mean store up to _exactly_ that number of elements</span>
<span class="token comment"># per list node.</span>
<span class="token comment"># The highest performing option is usually -2 (8 Kb size) or -1 (4 Kb size),</span>
<span class="token comment"># but if your use case is unique, adjust the settings as necessary.</span>
<span class="token attr-name">list-max-listpack-size</span> <span class="token attr-value">-2</span>

<span class="token comment"># Lists may also be compressed.</span>
<span class="token comment"># Compress depth is the number of quicklist ziplist nodes from *each* side of</span>
<span class="token comment"># the list to *exclude* from compression.  The head and tail of the list</span>
<span class="token comment"># are always uncompressed for fast push/pop operations.  Settings are:</span>
<span class="token comment"># 0: disable all list compression</span>
<span class="token comment"># 1: depth 1 means &quot;don't start compressing until after 1 node into the list,</span>

<span class="token comment"># 2: [head]-&gt;[next]-&gt;node-&gt;node-&gt;...-&gt;node-&gt;[prev]-&gt;[tail]</span>
<span class="token comment">#    2 here means: don't compress head or head-&gt;next or tail-&gt;prev or tail,</span>
<span class="token comment">#    but compress all nodes between them.</span>
<span class="token comment"># 3: [head]-&gt;[next]-&gt;[next]-&gt;node-&gt;node-&gt;...-&gt;node-&gt;[prev]-&gt;[prev]-&gt;[tail]</span>

<span class="token comment"># of just strings that happen to be integers in radix 10 in the range</span>
<span class="token comment"># of 64 bit signed integers.</span>
<span class="token comment"># The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of the</span>
<span class="token comment"># set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.</span>
<span class="token attr-name">set-max-intset-entries</span> <span class="token attr-value">512</span>

<span class="token comment"># Similarly to hashes and lists, sorted sets are also specially encoded in</span>
<span class="token comment"># order to save a lot of space. This encoding is only used when the length and</span>

<span class="token attr-name">zset-max-listpack-value</span> <span class="token attr-value">64</span>

<span class="token comment"># HyperLogLog sparse representation bytes limit. The limit includes the</span>
<span class="token comment"># 16 bytes header. When an HyperLogLog using the sparse representation crosses</span>
<span class="token comment"># this limit, it is converted into the dense representation.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># A value greater than 16000 is totally useless, since at that point the</span>
<span class="token comment"># dense representation is more memory efficient.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The suggested value is ~ 3000 in order to have the benefits of</span>
<span class="token comment"># the space efficient encoding without slowing down too much PFADD,</span>
<span class="token comment"># which is O(N) with the sparse encoding. The value can be raised to</span>
<span class="token comment"># ~ 10000 when CPU is not a concern, but space is, and the data set is</span>
<span class="token comment"># composed of many HyperLogLogs with cardinality in the 0 - 15000 range.</span>
<span class="token attr-name">hll-sparse-max-bytes</span> <span class="token attr-value">3000</span>

<span class="token comment"># Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in</span>
<span class="token comment"># order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level</span>
<span class="token comment"># keys to values). The hash table implementation Redis uses (see dict.c)</span>
<span class="token comment"># performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table</span>
<span class="token comment"># that is rehashing, the more rehashing &quot;steps&quot; are performed, so if the</span>
<span class="token comment"># server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used</span>
<span class="token comment"># by the hash table.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to</span>
<span class="token comment"># actively rehash the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># If unsure:</span>
<span class="token comment"># use &quot;activerehashing no&quot; if you have hard latency requirements and it is</span>
<span class="token comment"># not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply from time to time</span>
<span class="token comment"># to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># use &quot;activerehashing yes&quot; if you don't have such hard requirements but</span>
<span class="token comment"># want to free memory asap when possible.</span>
<span class="token attr-name">activerehashing</span> <span class="token attr-value">yes</span>

<span class="token comment"># The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients</span>
<span class="token comment"># that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a</span>
<span class="token comment"># common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the</span>
<span class="token comment"># publisher can produce them).</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># normal -&gt; normal clients including MONITOR clients</span>
<span class="token comment"># replica -&gt; replica clients</span>
<span class="token comment"># pubsub -&gt; clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># client-output-buffer-limit &lt;class&gt; &lt;hard limit&gt; &lt;soft limit&gt; &lt;soft seconds&gt;</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if</span>
<span class="token comment"># the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of</span>
<span class="token comment"># seconds (continuously).</span>
<span class="token comment"># So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is</span>
<span class="token comment"># 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately</span>
<span class="token comment"># if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get</span>
<span class="token comment"># disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes</span>
<span class="token comment"># the limit for 10 seconds.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data</span>
<span class="token comment"># without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only</span>
<span class="token comment"># asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster</span>
<span class="token comment"># than it can read.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and replica clients, since</span>
<span class="token comment"># subscribers and replicas receive data in a push fashion.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Note that it doesn't make sense to set the replica clients output buffer</span>
<span class="token comment"># limit lower than the repl-backlog-size config (partial sync will succeed</span>
<span class="token comment"># and then replica will get disconnected).</span>
<span class="token comment"># Such a configuration is ignored (the size of repl-backlog-size will be used).</span>
<span class="token comment"># This doesn't have memory consumption implications since the replica client</span>
<span class="token comment"># will share the backlog buffers memory.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.</span>
<span class="token attr-name">client-output-buffer-limit</span> <span class="token attr-value">normal 0 0 0</span>

<span class="token comment"># Client query buffers accumulate new commands. They are limited to a fixed</span>
<span class="token comment"># amount by default in order to avoid that a protocol desynchronization (for</span>
<span class="token comment"># instance due to a bug in the client) will lead to unbound memory usage in</span>
<span class="token comment"># the query buffer. However you can configure it here if you have very special</span>
<span class="token comment"># needs, such us huge multi/exec requests or alike.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># client-query-buffer-limit 1gb</span>

<span class="token comment"># In some scenarios client connections can hog up memory leading to OOM</span>
<span class="token comment"># errors or data eviction. To avoid this we can cap the accumulated memory</span>
<span class="token comment"># used by all client connections (all pubsub and normal clients). Once we</span>
<span class="token comment"># reach that limit connections will be dropped by the server freeing up</span>
<span class="token comment"># memory. The server will attempt to drop the connections using the most </span>
<span class="token comment"># memory first. We call this mechanism &quot;client eviction&quot;.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Client eviction is configured using the maxmemory-clients setting as follows:</span>
<span class="token comment"># 0 - client eviction is disabled (default)</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># A memory value can be used for the client eviction threshold,</span>
<span class="token comment"># for example:</span>
<span class="token comment"># maxmemory-clients 1g</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># A percentage value (between 1% and 100%) means the client eviction threshold</span>
<span class="token comment"># is based on a percentage of the maxmemory setting. For example to set client</span>
<span class="token comment"># eviction at 5% of maxmemory:</span>
<span class="token comment"># maxmemory-clients 5%</span>

<span class="token comment"># In the Redis protocol, bulk requests, that are, elements representing single</span>
<span class="token comment"># strings, are normally limited to 512 mb. However you can change this limit</span>
<span class="token comment"># here, but must be 1mb or greater</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># proto-max-bulk-len 512mb</span>

<span class="token comment"># Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like</span>
<span class="token comment"># closing connections of clients in timeout, purging expired keys that are</span>
<span class="token comment"># never requested, and so forth.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Not all tasks are performed with the same frequency, but Redis checks for</span>
<span class="token comment"># tasks to perform according to the specified &quot;hz&quot; value.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># By default &quot;hz&quot; is set to 10. Raising the value will use more CPU when</span>
<span class="token comment"># Redis is idle, but at the same time will make Redis more responsive when</span>
<span class="token comment"># there are many keys expiring at the same time, and timeouts may be</span>
<span class="token comment"># handled with more precision.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The range is between 1 and 500, however a value over 100 is usually not</span>
<span class="token comment"># a good idea. Most users should use the default of 10 and raise this up to</span>
<span class="token comment"># 100 only in environments where very low latency is required.</span>
<span class="token attr-name">hz</span> <span class="token attr-value">10</span>

<span class="token comment"># Normally it is useful to have an HZ value which is proportional to the</span>
<span class="token comment"># number of clients connected. This is useful in order, for instance, to</span>
<span class="token comment"># avoid too many clients are processed for each background task invocation</span>
<span class="token comment"># in order to avoid latency spikes.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Since the default HZ value by default is conservatively set to 10, Redis</span>
<span class="token comment"># offers, and enables by default, the ability to use an adaptive HZ value</span>
<span class="token comment"># which will temporarily raise when there are many connected clients.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># When dynamic HZ is enabled, the actual configured HZ will be used</span>
<span class="token comment"># as a baseline, but multiples of the configured HZ value will be actually</span>
<span class="token comment"># used as needed once more clients are connected. In this way an idle</span>
<span class="token comment"># instance will use very little CPU time while a busy instance will be</span>

<span class="token comment">########################### ACTIVE DEFRAGMENTATION #######################</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># What is active defragmentation?</span>
<span class="token comment"># -------------------------------</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Active (online) defragmentation allows a Redis server to compact the</span>
<span class="token comment"># spaces left between small allocations and deallocations of data in memory,</span>
<span class="token comment"># thus allowing to reclaim back memory.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Fragmentation is a natural process that happens with every allocator (but</span>
<span class="token comment"># less so with Jemalloc, fortunately) and certain workloads. Normally a server</span>
<span class="token comment"># restart is needed in order to lower the fragmentation, or at least to flush</span>
<span class="token comment"># away all the data and create it again. However thanks to this feature</span>
<span class="token comment"># implemented by Oran Agra for Redis 4.0 this process can happen at runtime</span>
<span class="token comment"># in a &quot;hot&quot; way, while the server is running.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Basically when the fragmentation is over a certain level (see the</span>
<span class="token comment"># configuration options below) Redis will start to create new copies of the</span>
<span class="token comment"># values in contiguous memory regions by exploiting certain specific Jemalloc</span>
<span class="token comment"># features (in order to understand if an allocation is causing fragmentation</span>
<span class="token comment"># and to allocate it in a better place), and at the same time, will release the</span>
<span class="token comment"># old copies of the data. This process, repeated incrementally for all the keys</span>
<span class="token comment"># will cause the fragmentation to drop back to normal values.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Important things to understand:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># 1. This feature is disabled by default, and only works if you compiled Redis</span>
<span class="token comment">#    to use the copy of Jemalloc we ship with the source code of Redis.</span>
<span class="token comment">#    This is the default with Linux builds.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># 2. You never need to enable this feature if you don't have fragmentation</span>
<span class="token comment">#    issues.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># 3. Once you experience fragmentation, you can enable this feature when</span>
<span class="token comment">#    needed with the command &quot;CONFIG SET activedefrag yes&quot;.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># The configuration parameters are able to fine tune the behavior of the</span>
<span class="token comment"># defragmentation process. If you are not sure about what they mean it is</span>
<span class="token comment"># a good idea to leave the defaults untouched.</span>

<span class="token comment"># Active defragmentation is disabled by default</span>

<span class="token comment"># It is possible to pin different threads and processes of Redis to specific</span>
<span class="token comment"># CPUs in your system, in order to maximize the performances of the server.</span>
<span class="token comment"># This is useful both in order to pin different Redis threads in different</span>
<span class="token comment"># CPUs, but also in order to make sure that multiple Redis instances running</span>
<span class="token comment"># in the same host will be pinned to different CPUs.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Normally you can do this using the &quot;taskset&quot; command, however it is also</span>
<span class="token comment"># possible to this via Redis configuration directly, both in Linux and FreeBSD.</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># You can pin the server/IO threads, bio threads, aof rewrite child process, and</span>
<span class="token comment"># the bgsave child process. The syntax to specify the cpu list is the same as</span>
<span class="token comment"># the taskset command:</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Set redis server/io threads to cpu affinity 0,2,4,6:</span>
<span class="token comment"># server_cpulist 0-7:2</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Set bio threads to cpu affinity 1,3:</span>
<span class="token comment"># bio_cpulist 1,3</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Set aof rewrite child process to cpu affinity 8,9,10,11:</span>
<span class="token comment"># aof_rewrite_cpulist 8-11</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># Set bgsave child process to cpu affinity 1,10,11</span>
<span class="token comment"># bgsave_cpulist 1,10-11</span>

<span class="token comment"># In some cases redis will emit warnings and even refuse to start if it detects</span>
<span class="token comment"># that the system is in bad state, it is possible to suppress these warnings</span>
<span class="token comment"># by setting the following config which takes a space delimited list of warnings</span>
<span class="token comment"># to suppress</span>
<span class="token comment">#</span>
<span class="token comment"># ignore-warnings ARM64-COW-BUG</span>
